 Final Assignment journal: 3d character controller w/ blend tree animations. 

I had made this out to be much more than it was in my head, I've been working to get over 
the fear of trying new things and not letting it paralyze me until last minute where I have
to learn it or die trying. While I don't feel I did great on that, it is something I am 
trying to work on, most assignments when I am doing them are fun when I'm not stuck on something.
Progress even little bits is a nice feeling. 

I wanted a character that would stand out from the rest, if we all were choosing 
from the same list some people might pick the same one. 
I had found the least visually appealing model I could and tweaked the animations to look as 
drunk as possible, I think i did a good job at that. The job was hard to get looking right.
The problem was that he would either start the jog animation at the correct speed and then
look as though he was sliding right before the run and vise versa. 
I modified the animation timing on all of the others to line up and work off of the jog. 
I am curious as to what the usage rights to mixamo is, I'd be interested in using their system 
to rig models quickly to try with some assets I bought in the unity store to see how they would look. 

Conclusion "I'm walkin here!"
